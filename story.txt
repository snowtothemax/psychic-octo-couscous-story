Once upon a time there was an old man that lived in a tower named Hank. Hank had no friends and almost never made it out of his little tower. One day, a little boy stopped by the tower. He said "hey old man! Give me all of your money!" So, the old man threw down a 
few coins and the boy went on his way. Then the next day, two more people came back, one of them being the little boy, and the other a friend of the little boys. They both said "Hey old man, give us some more money!" The old man threw down a few more coins and they went on their way. The NEXT day, three little kids arrived, the two from the day before and a new friend. They said "Hey old man, give us some money!" The old man in the tower
threw himself over the edge in front of the boys, dead.

The three little boys screamed but were only scared for a moment. One of the boys said "I wonder if he has any coins on him?" The three little boys searched the old man's corspe. They wasn't any coins but instead they found a key. The three little boys used the key on the front door of the tower. CLICK! The door unlocked and the three little boys could not beleive what was inside.
